## Project setup
We can do this project locally on our machine or in the cloud using the pre-installed environment on VS code. Vs code is a great option if you're on a mobile phone,
or just want to get started without installing anything. We use remix here.
## ## Description

    string public myCity = "Harshita";

}

The project will be running on our localhost.
